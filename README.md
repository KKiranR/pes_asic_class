# VLSI Physical Design for ASICs 

### Special topic 
## Objective
The objective of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design for ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is to transform a logical design description (RTL - Register Transfer Level) into a physical layout that can be fabricated as an integrated circuit. This involves translating the high-level functional representation of the circuit into a physical implementation that meets design constraints, performance targets, and manufacturability requirements.

# SKILL OUTCOMES
+ Architectural Design
+ RTL Design / Behavioral Modeling
+ Floorplanning
+ placement
+ clock Tree Synthesis
+ Routing

# INSTALLATION
https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals/blob/master/run.sh
Download the run.sh file and Run commands individualy and carefully 
Run the following commands
```
cd
gedit .bashrc
```
Then gedit will open then add the following line at the end of the file 
```
export PATH=<your installation directory>/riscv_toolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2019.08.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH
